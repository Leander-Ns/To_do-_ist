# To_do_list

This website is an to do list.

Write what you want to do and or remember in the input field and click the button on the right "Add to list". your items will be added in to a box where you can scroll down and see all your tasks as it fills up

An item added to the list can be checked off wich will give your item a linetrough like this: <s>your item</s>

Remember to uncheck an item before deleting it off your to do list. If not your counter will be incorrect (bug fix in progress)

The amount of items you have added to your list is displayed opposed to how many of them you have checked off. like this 3/1
